Simulated RVC data

\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of the dataset. ~~
Simulated data for three years of sampling (\strong{not actual data}) and two species, the Mangrove Snapper (\emph{Lutjanus griseus}), and the Red Grouper (\emph{Epinephelus morio})

\usage{data(rvc2)}
\format{
  A data frame with 8019 observations on the following 8 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{YEAR}}{a numeric vector indicating the year}
    \item{\code{STRAT}}{a factor with levels: \code{INPR} Inshore patch reef, \code{MCPR} Mid-channel patch reef, \code{OFPR} Offshore patch reef, \code{FSLR} Fore-reef shallow low-relief, \code{FMLR} Fore-reef medium depth low-relief,  \code{FDLR} Fore-reef deep low-relief, and \code{HRRF} High relief reef}
    \item{\code{PRIMARY_SAMPLE_UNIT}}{A factor with different codes for every primary sample unit}
    \item{\code{STATION_NR}}{a numeric vector indicating the secondary sample at a given primary sampling unit}
    \item{\code{SPECIES_CD}}{a factor with codes for each species composed of the first three letters of the generic name and the first four letters of the specific name. In this case \code{LUT GRIS} and \code{EPI MORI}}
    \item{\code{NUM}}{a numeric vector indicating the count averaged among divers at a given secondary unit}
    \item{\code{LEN}}{a numeric vector indicating the length class observed at a secondary sampling unit}
    \item{\code{MPA_NR}}{a numeric vector indicating whether a primary sample unit is in a protected area (1) or not (0)}
  }

The generating function for the density was a poisson distribution with a lambda of 0.24 for Lutjanus griseus for all years and strata, and 0.125 for Epinephelus morio for all years and strata. For the lengths, the generating function was a normal distribution with a mean of 25 and a standard deviation of 3 for Lutjanus griseus and 41 with a standard deviation of 4 for Epinephelus morio. 
MPA_NR were generated by randomly assigning 1 or 0 to any PSU in any stratum with probabilities of 0.2 and 0.8, respectively.
